Static sites are scalable, secure and have very little required maintenance. They come with a drawback though. Not everybody feels good editing files, building a project and uploading it somewhere. This is where Aamu.app comes into play.

With Aamu.app and Gatsby you can connect your favorite static site generator with an API that provides an easy to use interface for people writing content and automate the publishing using services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Features

* Simple content model and structure. Easy to adjust to your needs.
* Aamu.app integration using our [Sync API](https://aamu.app/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/synchronization/initial-synchronization-of-entries-of-a-specific-content-type)
* Using our [Delivery API](https://aamu.app/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/).
* Responsive/adaptive images via [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/)
